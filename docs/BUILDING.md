# Building

## Requirements

| Tool | Version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Git | any recent | submodules |
| CMake | 3.20+ | required by N64Recomp and the runtime |
| Ninja | any | the generator every upstream project assumes |
| Clang | 15+ | N64Recomp's output is validated against Clang and MSVC |
| Python | 3.10+ | splat and the symbol tooling in `tools/` |
| MIPS binutils | any | assembling the disassembly into an ELF (phase 01) |

**Do not build with modern GCC.** Recompiled output has a documented history of
miscompiling under modern GCC's optimizer. CMake will warn if you try.

### Windows

Verify what you have:

```powershell
pwsh -File tools/check_toolchain.ps1
```

Install what you don't (run in an elevated terminal):

```powershell
winget install --id Kitware.CMake
winget install --id Ninja-build.Ninja
winget install --id LLVM.LLVM
winget install --id Python.Python.3.12
winget install --id Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools `
    --override "--quiet --wait --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended"
```

The Build Tools install supplies the Windows SDK and the C runtime that Clang
links against on Windows; Clang alone is not enough.

A MIPS assembler is not available through winget. Phase 01 needs one of:

- **WSL** (`sudo apt install binutils-mips-linux-gnu`) — simplest, and what most
  decompilation projects assume.
- A prebuilt `mips64-elf` toolchain on `PATH`.

The Microsoft Store `python` stub on a fresh Windows install is not Python. If
`python --version` opens the Store, install the real thing with the winget
command above.

## Clone

```
git clone --recurse-submodules <this repo>
```

If you already cloned without submodules:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Configure and build

The project is phase-gated so a partially finished tree always builds. Phase 00
needs no options:

```
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang
cmake --build build
```

Later phases turn on what they earn:

| Option | Turned on by | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `WR64_BUILD_RECOMPILER` | phase 02 | builds the N64Recomp tool from `lib/` |
| `WR64_WITH_RECOMPILED` | phase 02 | compiles the generated `RecompiledFuncs/` |
| `WR64_WITH_RUNTIME` | phase 03 | links ultramodern, librecomp and RT64 |

## Verify your dump

```
./build/WaveRace64Recomp --identify path/to/your.z64
```

Exit code 0 means the dump matches the pinned target. Anything else means stop
and fix that before continuing — a mismatched revision produces failures later
that look like tooling bugs.
